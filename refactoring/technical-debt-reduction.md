## Request
Help me create a technical debt reduction plan:

**Debt Assessment:**
1. Categorize technical debt:
   - Code quality issues
   - Architectural problems
   - Missing tests
   - Outdated dependencies
   - Documentation gaps
   - Infrastructure issues

2. Impact analysis:
   - Development velocity impact
   - Maintenance burden
   - Bug risk
   - Security concerns
   - Scalability limitations

**Prioritization:**
1. Score each debt item by:
   - Impact (1-10)
   - Effort to fix (1-10)
   - Risk if not fixed (1-10)

2. Calculate priority score
3. Identify quick wins
4. Identify items to defer

**Reduction Strategy:**
For high-priority items:
1. Specific refactoring needed
2. Estimated effort
3. Risk assessment
4. Dependencies
5. Testing requirements

**Incremental Approach:**
1. Break large tasks into smaller chunks
2. Integrate with feature work
3. Set aside dedicated time
4. Boy Scout Rule opportunities

**Prevention:**
1. Coding standards to establish
2. Review process improvements
3. Automated checks to add
4. Definition of "Done" updates
5. Documentation requirements

**Metrics:**
How to measure progress:
1. Code quality metrics
2. Test coverage
3. Deployment frequency
4. Bug rates
5. Developer satisfaction

**Roadmap:**
Create a 3-6 month plan:
1. Month 1 goals
2. Month 2 goals
3. Month 3 goals
4. Long-term goals

**Communication:**
1. Stakeholder messaging
2. Business value explanation
3. Progress reporting

Provide:
- Concrete, actionable items
- Realistic estimates
- Clear success criteria
- Balance between debt reduction and feature work
