# Design Pattern Application

## Current Code
```[LANGUAGE]
[CURRENT_CODE]
```

## Problem Statement
Current design issues:
[DESCRIBE_THE_DESIGN_PROBLEMS]

Requirements:
- [REQUIREMENT_1]
- [REQUIREMENT_2]
- [REQUIREMENT_3]

## Context
- Language: [LANGUAGE]
- Framework: [FRAMEWORK]
- Scale: [USAGE_SCALE]
- Future needs: [ANTICIPATED_CHANGES]

## Request
Help me apply appropriate design patterns to solve these problems:

**Pattern Selection:**
1. Identify which design patterns are applicable:
   - Creational (Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype)
   - Structural (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy)
   - Behavioral (Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method, etc.)

2. Explain why each pattern fits
3. Compare alternatives
4. Recommend the best pattern(s) for this scenario

**Pattern Implementation:**
For each recommended pattern provide:
1. Pattern structure diagram (text/ASCII)
2. Implementation code with clear class/interface definitions
3. How it solves the current problems
4. Usage examples
5. Integration with existing code

**Benefits:**
1. How it improves the design
2. Flexibility gained
3. Maintainability improvements
4. Testability improvements

**Trade-offs:**
1. Complexity added
2. Performance implications
3. When not to use this pattern
4. Alternative approaches

**Migration:**
1. Step-by-step refactoring plan
2. How to maintain backward compatibility
3. Testing strategy
4. Gradual rollout approach

**Best Practices:**
1. Pattern-specific best practices
2. Common pitfalls to avoid
3. Naming conventions
4. Documentation needs

Ensure the solution:
- Solves the actual problem without over-engineering
- Fits the language idioms
- Is maintainable by the team
- Has clear benefits over simpler approaches
