## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Browse** the categories above to find the type of task you're working on
2. **Open** the relevant prompt markdown file
3. **Copy** the prompt template
4. **Fill in** the placeholders (marked with `[BRACKETS]`) with your specific context
5. **Submit** the customized prompt to your AI assistant

## 💡 Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific**: Fill in all relevant details rather than leaving placeholders
- **Provide context**: Include relevant code, error messages, or background information
- **Set constraints**: Clearly state what can and cannot be changed
- **Define success**: Specify what a good outcome looks like
- **Iterate**: Refine your prompt based on the AI's response

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to contribute new prompts or improve existing ones! Each prompt should:
- Follow the established format with clear sections
- Use placeholders in `[BRACKETS]` for customizable fields
- Include a "Request" section that clearly states what you want the AI to provide
- Be practical and based on real-world development scenarios
